                <p>I have been working as an instructional designer and a faculty member in higher education for ten years. After pursuing my second master's degree in Instructional Systems Technology at Indiana University Bloomington, I am now an instructional designer at the University of Akron. </p>
                <p> I have extensive knowledge in Instructional Design, adult learning, and cutting-edge learning technologies. I would like to use my professional knowledge to help faculty improve their teaching through technology. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my portfolio.</p>
