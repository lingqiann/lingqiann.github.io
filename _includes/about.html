                <p>I worked as an instructional designer and a faculty member in higher education for the past ten years. After pursuing my seconde Master's degree in Instructional Systems Technology at Indiana University Bloomington, I will set sail again in the higher education ocean. I am also a mom of two wonderful daughters, and a woman who loves the world and the life. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my portfolio.</p>
